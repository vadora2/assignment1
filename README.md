My personal portfolio where my achievements, community work and portfolio is. It tells people my educational background, what I'm interested and what I'm experienced in.
My personal portfolio is also a creative outlet which shows my personality. Vibrant with many colours and fun with many different interactions. With something happening with every hover and click. I also have my own description of myself and pictures of the said events to make the whole website more cohesive and digestable. I also have icons which bring the viewer to my social media for contact and a special page to get the viewer's personal contact.

This website is for those looking for an intern or interested to learn more about me and my academic background. Not only that, I also share about what I spend my time on aside fromwschool which helps the viewers get to know me more. If people were to be interested in hiring a student who's ready to learn and pick up new skills, my website would show them that i am a suitabe candidate for their position. It shows my creativity, my hard work and laso my commitment to the things I am passionate about.

my design process was simple. Elegant and minimal whilst being vibrat and attractive. In my wireframe, i also included a slideshow with a bunch of pictures to display my achievements. Which I did implement but in a different manner to make it seem like I have more pictures. It makes scorlling through the website more of an experience.
